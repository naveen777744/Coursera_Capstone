Information 

To help Jeronimo in his hunt we should get to following information: 

- The Localities of Bogotá, Colombia from Wikipedia: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Localidades_de_Bogot%C3%A1 

- The directions (scope, longitude) ot these Localities of Bogotá from Open Street Map APIs 

- From Foursquare we will require following scenes information: 

- the burger joint settings of the Localities 

- the workplaces settings of the Localities 

- the secondary schools settings of the Localities 

- the colleges settings of the Localities 

We will at that point influence the information so as to figure out which area is the most proper so as to find the burger joint.
